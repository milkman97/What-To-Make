# What-To-Make
Synopsis

In short, this project has a user select a bunch of different foods to send to a database and then retrieves some recipies that they can try to make at home.

Code Explination

When you download and open the project up, you will see index.php, which holds all the html code for the website. In the php folder, there are sub folders that hold all the sub categories of food, for instance, the fruit folder holds all the berries. In each of the php files in the php folder, one will see a simple for loop that loops an arrary and constructs all the objects/checkboxes. From there, the js folder holds a js file that has a function where it hides and shows all the content. The css file is just used for styling and hiding all the rows on each load. 

Motivation

This project simply exists to solve the problem of what to make with the food in our fridges. While we all have our prefrences on things we like to make, it is good to broaden our culture. Although the problem lies in that people don't want to search a cookbook for hours to make sure they have everything needed, its just really cumbersome to be doing. This project is aimed at making that process faster and easier for all people.

Installation

To have this project run correctly, simply download MAMP for your computer to host it offline locally. Everything else from there should work because the materalize source code is included with this project
Also make sure to have installed Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: * 1.0.3 extension from the chrome store if you are using chrome so the api call works correctly
